## About

This repository contains yearly-average population-weighted
PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels for countries that was used for a
project and related publications on air quality knowledge (AQ-IQ) and
PM2.5 levels for the top 10 populous countries in the world. All data in
this public repository is free for use and download as they are
generated using open-source datasets. Pop-weighted yearly-average
PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels are available for the top 10
populous countries in the world: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India,
Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, and United States for the
years 2019 to 2021.

## Data sources used

1.  The global annual PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels can be
    accessed from [Atmospheric Composition Analysis
    Group](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/#V5.GL.03).
2.  The maps files can be accesseed from
    [GADM](https://gadm.org/index.html).
3.  The global population distribution data can be accessed from
    [LandScan Global Population
    Database](https://www.eastview.com/resources/e-collections/landscan/).

### Variables of interest

1.  **NAME_X** = name of administrative unit for the associated
    PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration levels
2.  **PM25_XXXX** = raw annual average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration
    levels for year XXXX
3.  **pop_XXXX** = population density for year XXXX
4.  **pwpm_XXXX** = population weighted average PM<sub>2.5</sub>
    concentration levels for year XXXX
